For students who are above 10 years old or have more experience I would suggest introducing them to MIT App Inventor, Codecademy and Khan Academy. All include tutorials and support resources. With MIT APP Inventor students can build Android apps in a drag and drop environment that is similar to Scratch. With Codecademy and Khan Academy there are a range of step by step interactive tutorials that teach some of the most commonly used programming languages.
